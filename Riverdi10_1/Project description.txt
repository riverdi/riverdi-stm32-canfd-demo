Phase 1: Simulated input signal.
The project  currently is simulated on software level.
Once the project has been opened using TouchGFX, you can run the project on the 10.1" display.
Once the flash completed, the progress bar which indicates the charge level will go to 100 and back to zero as state of charge.
Once USR BTN 1 is pressed, the charging indicator shall start to indicate the charging is in progress.
--------------------------Done----------------------------------

Phase 2: Battery Level and Status Reception over CAN-FD Bus
The full CAN-FD driver has been developed and the 10.1 is able to receive the status and the level of the battery 
from 7.0" display over CAN-FD bus.
--------------------------Done----------------------------------

Phase 3: If the communication from the battery simulator is lost, the 10.1" shall 
display there is an issue with the HV system. Pull over safely.




Connection:
Please connect CAN1 of Riverdi 10.1" to CAN1 of Riverdi 7.0".
Hold the reset button of the 7 inch, after 3 seconds, the 10.1 shall display
the error with the HV system.
This is emulated by using timeout.

To Do:
Proper code documentation.
